# Support statement for blueprints

The blueprints contained in this repository is a generic implementation of Red Hat's technical expertise applying our products to this particular use case. The intention is that, in the normal course of events, Red Hat consulting services would be engaged to apply this generic implementation to a specific customer use case.

The blueprints are published here publicly as part of our commitment to open collaboration. This repository does not carry any implicit or explicit statement regarding supportability of the software stack it delivers.  Some components, such as the blueprint itself, are community projects for which users can only get help via community channels.  Other components deployed by these blueprints may require a proper subscription or license with Red Hat or other 3rd party vendors and the support agreement for those can be found as part of the subscription or license definition.  

Red Hat offers no other warranty for the blueprint than that the blueprints are regularly validated, i.e. that they perform nominally using our internal continuous integration process but this comes only as an indication that no regressions were found using the limited test cases that we cover.  In no way does it constitute any form of warranty that Red Hat or the 3rd party will fix issues found within the blueprint or any of the components outside of separate subscription or licence agreements.
